# Top 7 react hooks every project should have.

#### low level primitives/building blocks
* always start with `use________`
* hooks work on top-level of the functional component.

1. useState - to keep data between renders (updating will fire re-rendering)
2. useEffect 
3. useContext - share data without passing props
4. useRef - to keep data between renders (updating does not fire re-rendering)
5. useReducer
6. useMemo - to memoize a calculation result
7. useCallback - to memoize a callback

#### Bonus!
Custom Hook
